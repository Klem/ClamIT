MockFTP [start [port] [filesystem [win || nix]] || stop || help]

 Port: port number between 0 and 65535
 Filesystem : win for windows system, nix for *nix and macOs

 The files that are loaded whithin the MockFTP at runtime are stored within the /ftp folder
 unles you provide an absolute wwwroot.
 You may dump files in this folder if you want to work with them during the FTP session.
 Files dumped are read and recreated at runtime within the FTP "filesystem",
 incuding their content so avoid dumping large /too many files or your memory will bloat.
 and the startup time take very long. 
 However, any java.lang.OutOfMemoryError will be caught and won't crash the JVM.
 Proper content recreation won't (more than likely) work properly with binaries. 
 Every changes made to the files during the FTP session do not affect the physical filestsyem.
 Changes are only reflected within the FTP session, even if you stop and restart the session.
