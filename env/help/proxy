ProxyConfig create || load [name] || unload [name] || delete [name] || list || help]";

 Manages the proxy configurations that can be used during a session if needed.
 A loaded proxy configuration will be applied to all command that make network call.
 The proxy configuration are stored within /proxies.
 Configurations are serialized and should therefore be NOT manually edited, although they can be mannually deleted.
 No verification are made concerning the input (port range, url validity...). I trust you are smart enough to know what you are doing.
 
 create : create a proxy configuration and asks. Information are asked along the way.
		  Creating a proxy with a name that already exists will replace the existing proxy configuration, if any and without warning.
		  name: the name given to the created configuration
		  host: ip or url
		  port:  0 > && < 65535
		  user: the username used for authentication. Leave blank if no authentication is required
		  pass: the password used for authentication. Leave blank if no authentication is required

 		  it will stay in use unless you unload it or end your session
